  runtime.

# v2.1.0

## New

- BareBrowser is now also available for Linux (x64, arm64, ia32, armv7l).
- The original URL (from the command line) is now accessible for URL handlers. Can be used to pass
  arbitrary data to URL handlers.
- Additional Linux compatible keyboard shortcuts.
- New keyboard shortcuts for going to the home page and to the internal home page (`ctrl+meta+up`,
  `ctrl+alt+up` / `ctrl+shift+meta+up`, `ctrl+shift+alt+up`).
- `Cmd` click (Mac) or `Ctrl` click (Linux/Windows) on a link opens a new window with the target URL
  *behind* the current active window.

## Changes

  `MenuState` since they now are valid for both Windows and Linux.

# v2.0.0

*This version is a rewrite of almost every aspect. Please see the README file on GitHub or the
builtin URL `bb://readme` of a standard BareBrowser distribution for detailed information.*

## New

- Complete redesign of the handling of URLs. Any URL handling is now delegated 
  to URL handlers. Every handler is a dynamically loaded small piece of JavaScript 
  and can easily be developed by users. This makes the browser more customizable 
  and to some extent scriptable.
- Refactorings of most of the code base.
- Loading indicator.
- Display an error page with description on failed page loads.
- Support for Apple Silicon and Windows Arm64 architectures.
