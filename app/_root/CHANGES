# 3.0.4

This is a pure maintenance release to keep up with newer Electron versions and to update some
dependencies with security problems.

## Changes

- Updated dependencies and upgraded to Electron 24.8.8.


# 3.0.3

This is a pure maintenance release to keep up with newer Electron versions and to update some
dependencies with security problems.

## Changes

- Updated dependencies and upgraded to Electron 24.8.3.


# 3.0.2

This is a pure maintenance release, mainly to keep up with newer Electron versions and to update
some dependencies with security problems.

## Changes

- Updated dependencies and upgraded to Electron 24.6.5.
- Fixed docs, updated license.


# 3.0.1

This is a pure maintenance release, mainly to keep up with newer Electron versions.

## Changes

- Updated dependencies and upgraded to Electron 24.4.0.
- Added '_setFocus' param to window bounds sample request handler.
- Better ESLint settings.


# 3.0

## New

- A new configuration option (`Window.LastWindowPosition`) stores the position of the last active
  browser window before the app is closed. With this option BareBrowser can apply the stored
  position to the *very first browser window* on the next application start. For compatibility
  reasons this feature is off by default.
- Added 'Copy image' to context menu.

## Changes

- **BREAKING**: Request handler no longer receive the URL as a string in `handleRequest(...)` but
  instead as an object with a single (string) property named `URL`. This URL property is writeable
  and can be modified or rewritten for subsequent handlers in the chain. For an example see the
  sample request handler in `lib/RequestHandlers/samples/WindowBoundsRequestHandler.js`.\
  *All your own or customized request handlers **must** be adapted to this new behaviour!*\
  Usually this is a matter of adding one or two lines of code.
- **BREAKING** Updated dependencies and upgraded to Electron 23.1.1. This is a breaking change
  because Electron 23.x dropped support for Windows 7, 8, 8.1, Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2. If
  you need to support these older Windows versions you may build your own version of BareBrowser and
  use Electron 22.x or 21.x which are still supported (see
  [Electron releases](https://releases.electronjs.org)).


# v2.3.1

## Changes

- Updated dependencies and upgraded to Electron 19.0.8.


# v2.3.0

## New

- Added a simple standard context menu on mouse right click.

## Changes

- Existing settings will no longer be overwritten when updating to a new version, which was too
  radical. The new procedure will just add new settings (if introduced by a new version) to the
  existing ones. Therefore it's no longer possible to 'update' user settings by re-deploying the
  current version. Instead such changes have to be applied manually in `settings.json` (see docs).
  A future version may introduce a procedure to overwrite/correct/reset existing user settings
  with a special file that could be part of a new version.
- Updated dependencies and upgraded to Electron 18.3.0.


# v2.2.0

## New

- Added new configuration setting `ElectronFlags` for passing command line switches to the Electron
  runtime.

## Changes

- Updated dependencies and upgraded to Electron 15.1.1.


# v2.1.0

## New

- BareBrowser is now also available for Linux (x64, arm64, ia32, armv7l).
- The original URL (from the command line) is now accessible for URL handlers. Can be used to pass
  arbitrary data to URL handlers.
- Additional Linux compatible keyboard shortcuts.
- New keyboard shortcuts for going to the home page and to the internal home page (`ctrl+meta+up`,
  `ctrl+alt+up` / `ctrl+shift+meta+up`, `ctrl+shift+alt+up`).
- `Cmd` click (Mac) or `Ctrl` click (Linux/Windows) on a link opens a new window with the target URL
  *behind* the current active window.

## Changes

- Modifications for the handling of new windows (as of Electron 14.x).
- Popup windows are now enabled by default.
- The settings `ToggleWin32Menu` and `Win32MenuState` have been renamed to `ToggleMenu` and
  `MenuState` since they now are valid for both Windows and Linux.
- Updated to Electron 14.0.0 and other current Node modules.

## Bugs

- Fixed loading of URL handlers.
- Documentation fix.


# v2.0.0

*This version is a rewrite of almost every aspect. Please see the README file on GitHub or the
builtin URL `bb://readme` of a standard BareBrowser distribution for detailed information.*

## New

- Complete redesign of the handling of URLs. Any URL handling is now delegated 
  to URL handlers. Every handler is a dynamically loaded small piece of JavaScript 
  and can easily be developed by users. This makes the browser more customizable 
  and to some extent scriptable.
- Refactorings of most of the code base.
- Loading indicator.
- Display an error page with description on failed page loads.
- Support for Apple Silicon and Windows Arm64 architectures.
